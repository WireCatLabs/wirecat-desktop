/**
 * A placeholder that takes the place of what loads into it, at that thing's final size, so nothing moves when it
 * arrives. Rules: docs/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Loading without layout shift".
 *
 * - `className` sizes a block (a row's height, a panel's box).
 * - `chars` makes it a run of text instead: as wide as that many characters of the surrounding font, and as tall as
 *   its line, so a version or a count can sit inside the sentence it will finish. Exact in the mono font.
 * - `label` is announced once, on the first placeholder of a group; the rest are silent.
